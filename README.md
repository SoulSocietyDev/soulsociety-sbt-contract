## What's SBT?
A Soulbound Token refers to a specific type of NFT where the Transfer function has been
removed through the Lock attribute. It is ideal for storing or proving unique information
that   belongs   to   an   individual.   It   can   be   used   effectively   to   handle   information   that   is
owned   by   individuals,   such   as   ID   authentication,   storage   of   key   personal   information
(degree certification, academic certification), and information that does not need to be
transferred and should not be transferred

## What's Growth-Type SBT?
![SBT History](./docs/history.png)

While   SBT   can   contain   basic   information,   they   have   limitations   in   representing   more
detailed attributes.
For example, consider a person A who loves coffee and has minted an SBT titled "Coffee
Lover". We have no fundamental way of knowing how much A loves coffee, or whether A
particularly likes Starbucks or Coffee Bean. SBT is well-suited for expressing a person's
history and character, but it has limitations when it comes to storing detailed information
that can express a true real life, such as what they like, how much they like it, how they
like it, and when they started liking it. Growth-Type SBT is structured to encapsulate more
of Real Life by containing these additional pieces of information

- Growth-Type SBT is an Soulbound Tokens which records theGrowth-Type(level) attribute and level achievement history of the SBT
````
- Adding Growth-Type(Level) attribute 
  - Growth-Type Attribute :  Indication of the enhancement of SBT expressed as 1, 2, 3, 4 ... N 
  - Growth-Type achievement history: URI that links to history information about when,where, and how the Level was achieved
